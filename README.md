# Google Play Store EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights into app ratings, reviews, pricing, and category distributions. The analysis helps identify trends and patterns in the mobile app ecosystem.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about apps available on the Google Play Store, including:
- App name
- Category
- Rating
- Reviews
- Size
- Installs
- Type (Free/Paid)
- Price
- Content Rating
- Genres
- Last Updated
- Current Version
- Android Version

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights
1. **Distribution of App Ratings**: Understanding how ratings are spread across different categories.
2. **Correlation Between Reviews and Ratings**: Checking if more reviews mean better ratings.
3. **Free vs. Paid Apps**: Analyzing pricing trends and their impact on downloads.
4. **Category-wise App Count**: Identifying the most popular categories.
5. **Impact of App Size on Installs**: Evaluating whether app size influences download counts.
6. **Trends in Content Ratings**: Analyzing age-group-based distribution of apps.

## 📷 Visualizations
Several insightful visualizations are included in this project, such as:
- Histograms and Boxplots for rating distributions
- Scatter plots for reviews vs. ratings
- Bar charts for category-wise app counts
- Pie charts for free vs. paid app distribution
