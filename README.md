# Google Play Store EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights into app ratings, reviews, pricing, and category distributions. The analysis helps identify trends and patterns in the mobile app ecosystem. Additionally, a **machine learning model** has been implemented to predict app ratings based on key features.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about apps available on the Google Play Store, including:
- App name
- Category
- Rating
- Reviews
- Size
- Installs
- Type (Free/Paid)
- Price
- Content Rating
- Genres
- Last Updated
- Current Version
- Android Version

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights
1. **Distribution of App Ratings**: Understanding how ratings are spread across different categories.
2. **Correlation Between Reviews and Ratings**: Checking if more reviews mean better ratings.
3. **Free vs. Paid Apps**: Analyzing pricing trends and their impact on downloads.
4. **Category-wise App Count**: Identifying the most popular categories.
5. **Impact of App Size on Installs**: Evaluating whether app size influences download counts.
6. **Trends in Content Ratings**: Analyzing age-group-based distribution of apps.
7. **Machine Learning Model for Rating Prediction**: 
   - Implemented a regression model using Scikit-learn to predict app ratings based on features like reviews, size, and category.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared score**.
   - Explored feature importance to understand key factors influencing ratings.

## 📷 Visualizations
Several insightful visualizations are included in this project, such as:
- Histograms and Boxplots for rating distributions
- Scatter plots for reviews vs. ratings
- Bar charts for category-wise app counts
- Pie charts for free vs. paid app distribution

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ShariqNauman/google_playstore_eda.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd google_playstore_eda
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook google_playstore_eda.ipynb
   ```

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the machine learning model for better prediction accuracy.
- Feature engineering for predictive modeling (e.g., predicting app success based on attributes).
- Sentiment analysis on user reviews.
- Time-series analysis for trends over the years.
